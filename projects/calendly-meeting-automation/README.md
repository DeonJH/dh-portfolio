# Calendly Meeting Automation Workflow

An intelligent n8n workflow that automatically creates and sends meeting invites when appointments are scheduled via Calendly. Users can choose between Google Meet or Microsoft Teams, with automated email confirmations and calendar integration.

## üéØ Project Overview

This automation solves the common problem of manual meeting link creation and distribution after someone books a Calendly appointment. It streamlines the entire process from booking confirmation to meeting setup.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Trigger**: Responds instantly to Calendly booking webhooks
- **Platform Choice**: Supports both Google Meet and Microsoft Teams
- **Smart Detection**: Reads meeting platform preference from booking form
- **Email Automation**: Sends professional confirmation emails with meeting details
- **Calendar Integration**: Creates calendar events with meeting links
- **Slack Notifications**: Optional team notifications for new bookings
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Architecture

```
Calendly Webhook ‚Üí Process Data ‚Üí Platform Switch ‚Üí Create Meeting ‚Üí Send Notifications
                                       ‚Üì
                              [Google Meet | MS Teams]
                                       ‚Üì
                              Merge Results ‚Üí [Email + Slack]
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Calendly Webhook Trigger**
   - Receives POST requests from Calendly when meetings are scheduled
   - Captures all booking details and attendee information

2. **Data Processing**
   - Extracts relevant meeting information
   - Parses booking form responses for platform preference
   - Structures data for downstream processing

3. **Platform Decision**
   - Uses conditional logic to determine meeting platform
   - Routes workflow to appropriate meeting creation service

4. **Meeting Creation**
   - **Google Meet Path**: Creates Google Calendar event with Meet link
   - **MS Teams Path**: Creates Teams meeting via Microsoft Graph API

5. **Result Merging**
   - Combines meeting creation results with original booking data
   - Prepares data for notification services

6. **Automated Notifications**
   - Sends confirmation email to attendee with meeting details
   - Optional Slack notification to team/organizer

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Required Integrations
- **Calendly**: Webhook configuration for booking events
- **Google Calendar API**: For Google Meet meeting creation
- **Microsoft Graph API**: For Teams meeting creation
- **Email Service**: For confirmation emails (SMTP/SendGrid)
- **Slack API**: For team notifications (optional)

### Prerequisites
1. **n8n Instance**: Self-hosted or cloud instance
2. **API Credentials**:
   - Google Calendar API credentials
   - Microsoft Graph API credentials
   - Email service credentials
   - Slack webhook URL (optional)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Google APIs
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Microsoft APIs  
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your_microsoft_client_id
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_microsoft_client_secret

# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email
SMTP_PASS=your_password

# Slack (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
```

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Calendly Configuration
1. Go to Calendly ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add new webhook pointing to your n8n instance:
   ```
   https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/calendly-webhook
   ```
3. Select "Invitee Created" event
4. Add custom form field for meeting platform preference

### 2. n8n Workflow Import
1. Copy the `workflow.json` content
2. In n8n, go to Import ‚Üí Paste workflow JSON
3. Configure credentials for each service

### 3. API Credentials Setup

#### Google Calendar API
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Calendar API
3. Create OAuth2 credentials
4. Add credentials to n8n

#### Microsoft Graph API
1. Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí App Registrations
2. Create new app registration
3. Add required permissions for Calendar.ReadWrite
4. Generate client secret
5. Add credentials to n8n

### 4. Testing
1. Create test Calendly booking
2. Monitor n8n execution log
3. Verify meeting creation and email delivery

## üîß Customization Options

### Platform Detection Logic
Modify the platform detection in the "Process Meeting Data" node:
```javascript
// Custom platform detection logic
const platformResponse = responses.find(r => 
  r.question.toLowerCase().includes('your custom question')
);
```

### Email Templates
Customize the confirmation email in the "Send Confirmation Email" node:
```html
<h2>Meeting Confirmed: {{ $json.eventName }}</h2>
<p>Your custom message here...</p>
```

### Additional Platforms
Add support for other meeting platforms by:
1. Adding new condition in Platform Switch
2. Creating new HTTP request node for the platform's API
3. Updating the merge logic

## üìä Benefits & ROI

### Time Savings
- **Before**: Manual meeting creation + email sending = ~3-5 minutes per booking
- **After**: Completely automated = ~0 minutes
- **ROI**: For 50 bookings/month = 2.5-4 hours saved

### Improved User Experience
- Instant meeting confirmations
- Professional, branded communications
- Reduced booking-to-meeting friction

### Operational Excellence
- Consistent process execution
- Reduced human error
- Scalable solution

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Error Handling
